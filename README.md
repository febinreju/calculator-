# Python Calculator Application

This is a simple calculator application built using Python's `tkinter` library for the graphical user interface (GUI). The calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Key Features:
- **Basic Operations**: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and decimal points.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Interactive button-based input with a clear display for entering and viewing expressions.
- **Additional Functions**: Includes backspace functionality for correcting input and a clear button to reset the calculator.

## How It Works:
- The calculator app displays an interface with numeric buttons (0-9), basic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), and utility buttons (`C`, `âŒ«`, `=`).
- The user can click buttons to build a mathematical expression, which is evaluated when the equal (`=`) button is pressed.
- Errors (such as invalid syntax) are handled gracefully by displaying "Error" on the screen.

This project demonstrates how to build a basic GUI application in Python using Tkinter, showcasing event handling, layout management, and simple arithmetic evaluation.
